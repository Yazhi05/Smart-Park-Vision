# Smart Park Vision
Smart Park Vision is a web-based intelligent parking management system designed to detect free parking spaces in real time using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. Leveraging the YOLO algorithm for object detection and OpenCV for image processing, the system accurately differentiates between occupied and vacant spots from CCTV feeds. Developed with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a live dashboard integrated with a database for efficient storage, retrieval, and scalable management. By preprocessing images and videos to enhance accuracy, the system significantly reduces the time spent searching for parking, optimizes facility usage, and improves the overall parking experienceâ€”particularly within our college campus.
